# Typesense DocSearch Styles

This is a fork of Algolia's awesome [DocSearch.js](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch) library, customized to send queries to [Typesense](https://typesense.org).

To be able to use this, you'd first need to setup and run the [Typesense DocSearch Scraper](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-docsearch-scraper).

#### What is Typesense?

If you're new to Typesense, it is an **open source** search engine that is simple to use, run and scale, with clean APIs and documentation.

Think of it as an open source alternative to Algolia and an easier-to-use, batteries-included alternative to ElasticSearch. Get a quick overview from [this guide](https://typesense.org/guide/).

## Usage

Read detailed step-by-step instructions on how to configure and setup this version of DocSearch.js on Typesense's dedicated documentation site: https://typesense.org/docs/latest/guide/docsearch.html.
