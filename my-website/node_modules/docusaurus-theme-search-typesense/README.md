# `docusaurus-theme-search-typesense`

[Typesense](https://typesense.org) search component for Docusaurus powered documentation sites.

This is a fork of the awesome [@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia) library customized to work with Typesense.

#### About Typesense

If you're new to Typesense, it is an **open source search engine** that is simple to use, run and scale, with clean APIs and documentation.

Think of it as an open source alternative to Algolia and an easier-to-use, batteries-included alternative to ElasticSearch. Get a quick overview from [this guide](https://typesense.org/guide/).
