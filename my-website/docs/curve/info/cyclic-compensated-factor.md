_**Type -** Float, **Domain -** Point_.  
A value along the curve from 0 to what ever the value should be at the endpoint compensating for cyclic curves; meaning if the curve is non-cyclic you'll get a value from 0 to 1, but if the curve is cyclic then it will evaluate what the proper factor should be if the value 1 would end up back at the start. - This is useful if you are tilting a curve and want it to line up at the start properly, or any other similar kind of situation.

:::danger Important

This node does not work properly for BÃ©zier, catmull Rom, or NURBS curves.
