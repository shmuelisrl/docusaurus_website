# Quaternion, Eulers & Rotation

These nodes pertain and are mainly centered around [Quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) which are a 4 dimensional number consisting of x, y, z, w, and are essential to having proper rotations without gimbal-lock etc.  
This category includes converters between Quaternions and Eulers, as well as between Axis-angles and Quaternions. This category also includes Quaternion math, vector rotation based on Quaternions, Quaternion interpolation [[SLERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp), SQI, and SQUAD], and Euler interpolation based on Quaternions - basically, I wrapped a Quaternion interpolation in Eulers for your convenience.

:::note

This section is temporary, and its nodes will be dissolved into its component category once I add in the rest of the field nodes.
